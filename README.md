# ⚙️ Module 2 – FastAPI Backend Core

This repo is part of the **MedEd-AI Builder Phase 1 Plan**, focused on building a clean, modular, and production-aligned backend using FastAPI. This will serve as the **API brain** of the NEETPrepGPT system — handling data requests, MCQ generation triggers, database logic, and more.
